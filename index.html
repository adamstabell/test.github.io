	<p>My name is Adam and I am a PhD candidate in the Atwood Lab at the University of California, Irvine. There I study heterogeneous populations of stem cells in adult human epidermis. To put it in more universal terms, I look at different types of stem cells in the outermost layer of your skin. The goal of my work is to understand how these different types of stem cells contribute to the normal healthy maintenance of the skin as well as how each type uniquely contributes to different diseases like psoriasis and basal cell carcinoma. <br><br>

	I was exposed to programming through my research which required me to analyze large datasets that contained information about 10s of 1,000s of cells collected from healthy and diseased human tissues. This got me interested in learning more about programming. My curiosity took me from R to python to SQL to HTML to CSS and so on.</p>

	I don't use social media but if I ever do, I will update the links below:
